# Laplace-DENSE
This repository contains the codes used by the owner on his magister's thesis.

For every subject and every case analyzed, a neural network must be trained, therefore, 24 .ipynb files are available, three for each subject. The correspondant folder of results are presented mostly empty. This is bcause the size of the files is too big, thus, github do not allows to upload them, but the folder with its sub-folder hierarchy is presented, so every code can be compiled downloading this repository.

The supplementary material are gifs of some results of some sections of the thesis.
